Algorithms to analyze data from MAVEN MISSION to MARS :

Algorithms written in Interative Data Language(IDL) software language to analyze observations made by various sensors onboard the MAVEN mission to understand the interaction between the solar-wind and Mars’ upper atmosphere.The MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN)) mission was launched on November 18, 2013, and entered orbit around Mars on September 21,2014. The MAVEN’s instrument suite consists of eight sensors:

·Magnetometer·Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer
·Langmuir Probe and Waves
·Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrometer
·Solar Wind Electron Analyzer (SWEA)
·Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA)
·Solar Energetic Particles
·SupraThermal And Thermal Ion Composition (STATIC)

Prof. Jasper Halekas is the instrument lead of the SWIA sensor.The analysis of the observations is aimed to contribute to the important science question of understanding the erosion of the Martian atmosphere with time. I am particularly interested in the escape of heavy ions out into the space during the radial orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field. Such orientation of interplanetary magnetic field is not very frequent, and all science questions related to MARS could be explored to understand how these change during the radial orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field.
