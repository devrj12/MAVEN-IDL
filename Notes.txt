Make SEA_reg1aa.pro handle "radial case" as well ! Perhaps, it already handles it. (but not exactly the way SEA_reg11 does !. So, it needs to be modified, but modify it to capture -- '2015-08-19-1731a1.sav' ! -- Modified and named SEA_reg1ab.pro) ! Perhaps, SEA_reg11 and SEA_reg1ab are same ! Check (Checked once, and I think they are (saved "2015-08-19-1731a1.sav" and "2015-08-19-1731a2.sav" ) ! -- And both of these could be run by SEA_reg3aa.pro

      (2.) Tailward Escape -- Multiple processes 
      (3.) Identifying any of these processes during radial conditions will be an excellent science endeavor !
      (4.) Different escape processes (ion escape channels :sources of electric fields - electric field accelerates it),  
               --motional electric field (-v x B)
               --ambi-polar electric field (associated with electron pressure gradient)
               --Hall electric field  (J x B)
                Two processes which are probably important in the tail-ward escape is ambi-polar electric field and Hall electric field. 
       The Hall electric field is there as the magnetic field is draped there, and there is magnetic tension -- that leads to Hall electric field on small scales. There are also a variety of dynamic processes, that people have hypothesized -- waves being one of them/magnetic reconnection, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, -- dynamic processes instead of quasi-static processes.  
     (5.) Plume escape - motional electric field (along the electric field). This is less likely as during radial conditions, the motional electric field is zero. 

In our observations, we have seen -- that despite the absence of the plume escape (no velocity along the electric field), the heavy ion (O2+) has been been transported to upstream solar wind region ? How does it get there (2016-08-15)? The question remains unanswered.  

So, is the electric field moving the heavy-ions? Are there tailward escape ? Why is there sudden change in direction (of the angles) at (slightly before) 19:00 UT on 2016-08-15? After 19:00, is it moving along the Electric Field ? Thanks.

In dong's paper, why should the tailward escape only be in -x direction ? Can't it be in any direction in the tailward region ? [That is the definition of the tailward escape].

[[From discussion with Prof. Halekas, it won't expect to see the plume or tailward escape unless the space-craft is in the right spot !]]

NEXT STEP : Look for normal (non-radial) days. And, build a mental image of what the configuartion in normal day looks like ? How the escape occurs in a normal day ? And then compare that with radial day? That will help to see the differences.

  -- Is it flowing along the Electric field during plume escape ? It looks so !
  -- Is it tailward just before the end of the orbit ?
  -- What do I make of the density plot -- which is mostly zero (not exactly ?) ? (The density is in units : 1/cm^3. The velocity is in units : 1/m^3).


2016-08-15-3664a2 
    -- Are the heavy-ions seen in Phi-A plot moving in the tailward direction (in the upstream region ! -- what process could be responsible : It is perpendicular to the electric field and opposite to the magnetic field !) ? ** Not exactly. There is a trace of O2+ just before the "background", and they are seen to be 'pushed' by the electric field. But, no clear sign of O2+.
    -- The absence of a well-defined bow-shock : induced magnetic field between 17:00 UT to 18:00 UT 
    -- What is intriguing is -- why the bow-shock is undefined in one of the but not the other ? It is due to the orientation of the magnetic field.

'2015-08-15-1711.sav'  -- non-radial example without plume escape ?

Since there is no plume escape, I don't see any escape of the O+ ions in the solar-wind region? But, the velocity plot has values, why?  
What does it mean ?


'2015-08-15-1712a2.sav'  -- very good example of radial ?

But what do the angular plots suggest ? There is non-solar particles seen in SWIA angle panels (mvn_swica_th_counts) ! But, in the STATIC energy panel (mvn_sta_c0_H_E), no heavy ions are seen ! Why ?

Does that mean there has been no escape of O+ -- in this case ! 

***
  -- Look for absence of induced magnetosphere ! It has been found to be absent during radial conditions in VENUS.

So, few observations have been made. (Plume escape being seen during non-radial conditions but not during radial. But, absence of disappearance of the induced magnetosphere during radial case. And escape of (although in very less amount) heavy-ions during radial -- we don't know. I will begin checking new case (in which the non-radial doesn't have plume)). Also, to do :
   (i) check for other heavy-ions
  (ii) look for parameters which influence induced magnetosphere : upstream solar wind, pressure, etc.
  (iii) Make statistical study !
